This game is all about guessing. You are presented with a card that has a value between 1-13. You are asked to guess if the next card’s value will be higher or lower. If you guess correctly, you get 100 points, but if you guess wrong then you lose 75 points. You start with a score of 300 points and will lose if you drop to a score of 0 points. You can play continually if you don’t lose all your points or say no to play again question.
